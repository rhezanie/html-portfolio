<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster.
 Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, 
 the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of
 Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of
 super-heroic dramatics.</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>An emotional and visual thrill ride. 
  Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a 
  timeless classic that can be watched time and time again 
  and will never get old. This movie will always continue to
   be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie.</p>

<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>A delightful family film. This is an astonishly effective 
    and pleasant remake of a very good film. It's light, 
    romantic, touching and downright funny.</p>
